# Timetable_scheduling

This project provides Timetable scheduling that is implimented using the concept of Graph coloring. It takes an input of the various courses along with a list of subjects associated with that course. A mapping is done on each of these courses for the various class-subject relations with the help of graphs. Depending on these relations graph colouring is done assigning a color for the various subjects. A final colored graph is then produced combining the course specific graphs. Based on this final graph, a lecturing schedule for the various courses is produced.
